## Hi there 👋
<br>
21062023: Thanx to a fellow ham, it seems that the tools download the old database instead of the new one. Please download the database from database-beta and use the tool to flash it. We will publish new versions asap.
<br><br>
19042023: MD280/M390 firmware is generated and works again. Database is pushed for the first time again, still fixxing small issues. Database updates ran a few times now without issues.
<br><br>
18042023: new server arrived and is installed.
<br><br>
17042023: new machine is ordered and paid (not sponsored, paid out of my own money) :) we hope that the old disk is ok, so we can get the scripts of it :)
<br><br>
16042023: We are having problems with our server that creates all the databases. This evening the server suddenly stopped (power supply died and blew the main fuse). We hope to have a new server running asap.
