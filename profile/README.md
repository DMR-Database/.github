## Hi there 👋
<br>
19042023: MD280/M390 firmware is generated end works again. Database is pushed for the first time again.
<br><br>
18042023: new server arrived and is installed.
<br><br>
17042023: new machine is ordered and paid (not sponsored, paid out of my own money) :) we hope that the old disk is ok, so we can get the scripts of it :)
<br><br>
16042023: We are having problems with our server that creates all the databases. This evening the server suddenly stopped (power supply died and blew the main fuse). We hope to have a new server running asap.
